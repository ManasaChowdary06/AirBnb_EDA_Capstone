# Airbnb_EDA_Capstone
Airbnb is an American company founded in 2008 that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals and tourism activities. It is  kind of service that connects the guest and host to share their property. Basically, property owner wants to utilize their property in the right direction so that for host it can be an income source and for guest, it can be a destination for a stay. The problem for Airbnb is there are tons of data generated through the hosts and guests as well. So, to find the right direction according to marketing and find the correct business-driven solution we did the data analysis on 49,000 observations  with 16 columns and it is a mix between categorical and numeric values. Through which we identify many solutions related to pricing, location, and room types that we mentioned in this project.

this is Airbnb's NYC(2019) dataset and is feature rich containing, location with co-ordinates, prices, host name, room types, availability throughout season and few others.

This is the AlmaBetter Capstone Project done as a team by- Manasa Kanakamedala, Mohd Talib, Tauseef Taufiq, Nitin Kumar.
